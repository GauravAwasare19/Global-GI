        <p>Global-GI Express specializes in shipping excess baggage or luggage/unaccompanied baggage through its air & road services to any destination within India. Global-GI Express enables customers to ship all their excess baggage/luggage, ensuring an easy solution to bypass the strict airline rules on extra luggage. It even offers the option of sending unaccompanied luggage from Pune to any destination within India.</p>
        <p>There are limitations for every airline on baggage and on its check-in baggage in the aircraft. If you are traveling within India, then airline companies allow their passengers to carry only 23 kg as free allowance baggage. Anything in excess of this allowance is called excess baggage.</p>
        <p>Excess baggage can be very expensive for a person traveling on a long-term assignment or deputation. Global-GI EXPRESS has the capability of shipping these excess baggages at the most economical rate and even offers doorstep delivery at the destination after doing customer clearance of the destination country, provided the baggage does not contain any banned, contraband, illegal, or restricted items.</p>
